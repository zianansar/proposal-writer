# Epic 0 Retrospective - February 7, 2026

**Project:** Upwork Research Agent
**Epic:** Epic 0 - Walking Skeleton (AI Proposal Generation Spike)
**Retrospective Date:** 2026-02-07
**Facilitator:** Bob (Scrum Master)
**Participants:** Zian (Project Lead), Dev Agent Team

---

## Executive Summary

Epic 0 delivered **4/5 stories completed** establishing a working Tauri application that generates AI proposals. However, the critical validation story (0-5) **FAILED** the 80% AI detection pass rate requirement, achieving only 20% (1/5 proposals passed).

**Key Metrics:**
- **Stories Completed:** 4/5 (Story 0-5 in progress with AC-2 FAILED)
- **Test Coverage:** 69 tests passing (grew from 9 → 29 → 54 → 69 across stories)
- **Code Reviews Conducted:** 4+ formal reviews (multiple rounds per story)
- **AI Detection Pass Rate:** 1/5 (20%) vs. required 4/5 (80%) - **FAILED**
- **Blockers:** 1 critical (AI detection validation failure)

**Timeline:**
- Epic started: ~February 2, 2026
- Epic effectively complete: February 5, 2026
- Duration: ~3-4 days

**Critical Finding:** Core product concept requires Epic 3 (Humanization) to be viable. Current AI generation produces content that is 68-100% AI-detectable.

## What Went Well (Successes)

### 1. Full Tech Stack Validated

**Evidence:** Story 0-1 successfully scaffolded Tauri v2 + React 19 + Vite 7 + Rust project.

**Impact:**
- Cross-platform desktop app foundation established
- Build pipeline verified (tsc + vite build + cargo build)
- Project structure documented for team reference

**Lesson:** Starting with a proper scaffold story pays dividends for all subsequent stories.

### 2. Claude API Integration Working

**Evidence:** Story 0-2 achieved 7.63s generation time (within <8s NFR-6 target).

**Impact:**
- 3-paragraph proposal generation (Hook, Bridge, CTA) functional
- Prompt boundary enforcement implemented (security)
- Error handling for network/API/timeout scenarios

**Lesson:** Direct HTTP integration with `reqwest` is simpler than SDK dependencies.

### 3. Streaming Implementation Successful

**Evidence:** Story 0-3 implemented 50ms token batching (AR-10) with Zustand state management.

**Impact:**
- Real-time token display reduces perceived latency
- 2-3 re-renders/sec vs 20/sec without batching
- SSE parsing for Anthropic streaming API working

**Lesson:** Token batching architecture decision paid off for UX performance.

### 4. Test Coverage Growth Maintained

**Evidence:**
- Story 0-1: 9 tests
- Story 0-2: 29 tests (+20)
- Story 0-3: 54 tests (+25)
- Story 0-4: 69 tests (+15)

**Impact:**
- High confidence in component behavior
- Regression testing prevents breaking changes
- Foundation for Epic 1+ testing patterns

**Lesson:** Maintaining test growth per story is sustainable.

### 5. Code Review Process Effective

**Evidence:** Multiple review rounds per story, catching issues like:
- CSP security concerns (Story 0-1)
- Error handling gaps (Story 0-2)
- Event listener race conditions (Story 0-3)
- Timer cleanup patterns (Story 0-4)

**Impact:**
- Critical bugs caught before production
- Architecture compliance validated
- Consistent code quality

**Lesson:** Adversarial code review with fresh context finds more issues than inline development.

## What Didn't Go Well (Challenges)

### 1. AI Detection Validation FAILED

**Evidence:** Story 0-5 results:
- SaaS/CRM: 25% AI (PASS)
- Automation: 68% AI (FAIL)
- UI/UX Design: 98% AI (FAIL)
- ML/Data Analysis: 89% AI (FAIL)
- Copywriting: 100% AI (FAIL)

**Impact:**
- AC-2 requires 4/5 pass (80%), achieved 1/5 (20%)
- Core product concept not validated
- Epic 3 (Humanization) becomes critical blocker

**Root Cause:** Base Claude generation without humanization produces highly detectable AI content.

**Action Required:** Epic 3 is MANDATORY for MVP, not optional polish.

### 2. Manual Testing Consistently Deferred

**Evidence:**
- Story 0-2: Performance timing manual verification marked "requires manual"
- Story 0-3: NFR-5 (<1.5s streaming start) marked "requires manual verification"
- Story 0-5: Extended tests (6-8) and human baseline still pending

**Impact:**
- NFR validation incomplete
- Pass/fail status uncertain for some acceptance criteria
- Technical debt in testing

**Root Cause:** No structured accountability for manual testing tasks.

**Action Required:** Assign explicit owners to manual test tasks before story starts.

### 3. HTTP Client Connection Pooling Deferred

**Evidence:** Stories 0-2, 0-3 both noted "HTTP client created per request" as deferred item.

**Impact:**
- Suboptimal performance under load
- Same issue flagged twice (redundant review finding)

**Root Cause:** Acceptable for spike scope, but carried forward as technical debt.

**Action Required:** Address in Epic 8 or when performance issues arise.

### 4. Rust Backend Tests Missing

**Evidence:** Story 0-2 and 0-3 reviews noted "Zero Rust backend tests - all tests mock Tauri invoke."

**Impact:**
- SSE parsing logic not unit tested
- Token batching logic not tested
- Claude API module untested

**Root Cause:** Frontend testing easier to implement; Rust testing deferred.

**Action Required:** Add Rust unit tests in Epic 8 comprehensive test suite.

## Key Insights & Lessons Learned

### 1. AI Detection is a CRITICAL Feature, Not Polish

**Insight:** The product's core value proposition (helping freelancers win proposals) is invalid if proposals are flagged as AI-generated and rejected by clients.

**Evidence:** 80% of generated proposals failed AI detection (68-100% AI scores).

**Application:**
- Epic 3 must be treated as MVP blocker, not post-launch feature
- Humanization techniques are essential, not optional
- Safety thresholds need calibration based on detection tool behavior

### 2. Technical Domains Pass Better Than Creative

**Insight:** SaaS/CRM proposal (technical, specific) passed; Copywriting proposal (creative) scored 100% AI.

**Evidence:**
- Technical domain (SaaS/CRM): 25% AI - PASS
- Creative domains (UI/UX, Copywriting): 89-100% AI - FAIL

**Application:**
- Industry-specific tuning may be required in Epic 3
- Creative writing needs more aggressive humanization
- Consider domain-aware humanization strategies

### 3. Walking Skeleton Validation is Valuable

**Insight:** Running the spike through AI detection early revealed critical blockers.

**Evidence:** If Epic 0-5 validation was skipped, AI detection failure would be discovered much later (post-Epic 6).

**Application:**
- Continue early validation for risky assumptions
- "Walking Skeleton" pattern exposes issues before infrastructure investment
- Validation stories should test product viability, not just technical function

### 4. Test Growth is Sustainable When Per-Story

**Insight:** Growing 15-25 tests per story is manageable and compounds value.

**Evidence:** 9 → 29 → 54 → 69 tests across 4 stories.

**Application:**
- Continue "tests included" policy per story
- Epic 1+ can expect similar growth rate
- Target 15-25 new tests per story

## Technical Debt Identified

### HIGH Priority (Must address before launch) - 8-12 hours

1. **Epic 3 Humanization (Story 0-5 blocker)**
   - **Issue:** 80% of proposals fail AI detection
   - **Impact:** Product unusable without fix
   - **Resolution:** Complete Epic 3 (Stories 3-1 through 3-7)

2. **Rust Backend Unit Tests** (4-6 hours)
   - **Issue:** Zero Rust tests for SSE parsing, token batching, API module
   - **Impact:** Logic bugs could go undetected
   - **Location:** `src-tauri/src/claude.rs`
   - **Tracked:** Deferred to Epic 8

### MEDIUM Priority (Address in next quarter) - 6-8 hours

3. **HTTP Client Connection Pooling** (2-3 hours)
   - **Issue:** Client created per request, no connection reuse
   - **Impact:** Suboptimal performance under repeated use
   - **Location:** `claude.rs:169`

4. **Complete Story 0-5 Manual Tests** (2-3 hours)
   - **Issue:** Extended tests (6-8) and human baseline pending
   - **Impact:** Incomplete validation data for Epic 3 calibration

5. **Timer Cleanup on Unmount** (2 hours)
   - **Issue:** CopyButton timer not cleaned up on unmount
   - **Impact:** Potential state update after unmount warning
   - **Location:** `CopyButton.tsx:26-28`

### LOW Priority (v1.1+) - 3-4 hours

6. **Event Constant Consolidation** (1-2 hours)
   - **Issue:** Event names duplicated in TypeScript and Rust
   - **Impact:** Drift risk between frontend/backend

7. **SVG Icons for Cross-Platform** (2 hours)
   - **Issue:** Emoji icons may render inconsistently
   - **Impact:** Minor visual inconsistency

**Total Estimated Debt:** 17-24 hours (excluding Epic 3 scope)

## Significant Discoveries

### Discovery 1: Epic 3 is Mandatory, Not Optional

**Finding:** Original plan allowed skipping Epic 0 if all 5 proposals passed detection. With 1/5 passing, Epic 3 humanization is essential for product viability.

**Impact on Roadmap:** Epic 3 MUST be sequenced before product launch. Recommend: Epic 0 → 1 → 2 → **3** → 4+

**Recommendation:** Treat Epic 3 as blocking Epic for MVP.

### Discovery 2: AI Detection Tools Vary Significantly

**Finding:**
- GPTCleanup: 45% human for same proposal
- ZeroGPT: 25% AI for same proposal
- Creative domains: 89-100% AI across tools

**Impact on Epic 3:** Need to calibrate against multiple detection tools, not just one.

**Recommendation:** Epic 3 should test against ZeroGPT, GPTZero, and Originality.ai.

### Discovery 3: Streaming Architecture Validated

**Finding:** 50ms token batching successfully reduces re-renders while maintaining real-time UX.

**Impact on Future Epics:** Architecture decision validated; can proceed with confidence.

**Recommendation:** Apply same batching pattern to future streaming features (Epic 5 voice analysis, etc.).

## Readiness Assessment

### Testing & Quality: ✅ Ready (for Epic 1)

**Status:** 69 tests passing. Code review process active.

**Gaps:**
- Rust backend tests missing
- Manual NFR validation incomplete

**Confidence Level:** HIGH for infrastructure; LOW for AI detection viability.

---

### Technical Health: ⚠️ Healthy with Blocker

**Status:** Tech stack validated, streaming working, tests passing.

**Blocker:**
- AI detection failure requires Epic 3 before launch

**Confidence Level:** MEDIUM - Core tech works, but product viability blocked.

---

### Product Viability: ❌ NOT VALIDATED

**Status:** Walking Skeleton failed validation (1/5 AI detection pass rate).

**Action Required:**
- Complete Epic 3 (Humanization) before launch
- Re-run Story 0-5 validation after Epic 3

**Confidence Level:** LOW - Product cannot launch without humanization.

---

## Retrospective Commitments

### Summary

- **Stories Completed:** 4/5 (80%)
- **AI Detection Pass Rate:** 1/5 (20% - FAILED)
- **Technical Debt:** 17-24 hours identified
- **Critical Blocker:** Epic 3 mandatory for product viability

### Next Steps

1. **Immediately:** Mark Epic 0 as "in-progress" (Story 0-5 incomplete)
2. **Product Decision:** PM to select option from Story 0-5 decision matrix
3. **Epic 1-2:** Proceed with infrastructure stories (database, encryption)
4. **Epic 3:** Prioritize as MVP blocker after Epic 2 completes
5. **Re-validation:** Re-run Story 0-5 after Epic 3 humanization is implemented

### Open Questions for PM

1. Accept 1/5 pass rate as "spike validation" and proceed? (Option 1)
2. Add basic humanization story (0-6) before Epic 1? (Option 2)
3. Commit to Epic 3 as mandatory MVP scope? (Option 3 - Dev Recommendation)
4. Pivot product strategy? (Option 4)
