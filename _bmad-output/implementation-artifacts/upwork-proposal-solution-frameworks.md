## How to Customize Any Framework

**Step 1: Select Framework**
- Match job category to framework
- If job spans multiple categories, combine elements

**Step 2: Replace Variables**
- [their specific goal/challenge] = extract from job title and description
- Technology mentions = use exact stack from job post when possible
- Timeline = realistic based on scope, slightly under-promise

**Step 3: Add Job-Specific Details**
- Mention specific features/requirements from job post (2-3 items)
- Address any pain points they mentioned
- Include industry-specific considerations if relevant

**Step 4: Adjust Complexity**
- Simple projects: 3 bullets
- Medium projects: 4 bullets (recommended)
- Complex projects: 4-5 bullets (don't exceed 5)

**Step 5: Quantify Where Possible**
- Add timelines (Week 1, within 48 hours, etc.)
- Include deliverable counts (8 blog posts, 15 screens, etc.)
- Mention metrics if relevant (90% test coverage, sub-200ms API response, etc.)

## Pro Tips for Solution Sections

1. **Mirror Their Language:** If they say "dashboard," don't say "interface." Use their exact terminology.

2. **Balance Detail:** Specific enough to show expertise, brief enough to stay under 80 words for this section.

3. **Lead with Value:** Each bullet should emphasize the outcome/benefit, not just the task.

4. **Order Matters:** Put the most impressive or unique element first or last (primacy/recency effect).

5. **Tech Stack Alignment:** If they mention specific tech, use it. If not, propose tools and briefly explain why.

---

**Remember:** This solution section should take up about 50-80 words of your 150-250 word proposal. It's the "meat" of your proposal but not the entire thing.

**Next Step:** Combine your customized solution framework with a hook (from Hook Library) and proof + CTA to create a complete proposal.
