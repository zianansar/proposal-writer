## Pro Tips for Maximum Impact

1. **Personalization Score Test:** Before sending, ask: "Could I send this exact hook to 3+ different jobs?" If yes, it's too generic.

2. **The 5-Second Test:** Client sees only first 2-3 lines in list view. Read just those lines—do they compel you to click? If not, revise.

3. **Name Research:** If client name not in job post, check:
   - Their review history (they leave feedback as their name)
   - Company website About page
   - When in doubt, use "Hi!" without name rather than "Dear Hiring Manager"

4. **Mobile Preview:** Read your hook on a phone. Make sure first sentence is powerful and complete.

5. **A/B Testing:** Track which hook formulas get best response rates for different job types. Double down on what works.

---

**Remember:** The hook is just the first 2-3 sentences. It must lead naturally into your solution paragraph while maintaining the same personalized, value-focused tone.

**Next Step:** Combine your chosen hook with a solution framework from the companion template library.
