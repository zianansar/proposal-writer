## Successes & Strengths

1. **Rapid delivery** — 4 implementation stories shipped in 3 days, from zero to working streaming AI proposal generator with clipboard integration.

2. **Solid architectural foundation** — The Tauri v2 + React 19 + Rust scaffold from Story 0-1 and the streaming architecture from Story 0-3 (Tauri events → Zustand → UI with 50ms token batching) became the pattern used across 8+ subsequent epics with zero rework.

3. **Clean project setup** — Story 0-1 scaffolded the entire project in a single pass with zero debug issues. Rare for a new project with Tauri v2, React 19, and Rust.

4. **Code reviews caught real issues** — Security (CSP, prompt injection), accessibility (aria-live), performance (tokio features bloat), and version pinning were all caught and fixed through the review process.

5. **ensureListenersReady() pattern** — The fix for the event listener race condition in Story 0-3 prevented what would have been a systemic bug across all event-driven features.

6. **Early concept validation** — Story 0-5 surfaced a critical product-level concern (AI detection) at the spike stage, before infrastructure investment. This is exactly what a Walking Skeleton should do.

---

## Challenges & Growth Areas

1. **Core concept validation FAILED** — AI-generated proposals are highly detectable. Round 1: 1/5 passed (20%). Round 2 with Epic 3 humanization: 0/5 passed. The product's core value proposition failed validation.

2. **AI detection scores are stochastic** — Same prompt + same model produced wildly different detection scores across runs (e.g., SaaS/CRM went from 25% to 73% between rounds). Deterministic pass/fail criteria on non-deterministic tools is unreliable.

3. **Zero Rust backend tests** — All 69 tests mock the Tauri invoke boundary. The actual API module, SSE parsing, and token batching logic in Rust have no tests. Flagged in Stories 0-2 and 0-3.

4. **Technical debt deferred to "Epic 8" as catch-all** — Multiple review items were kicked to "Epic 8 comprehensive test suite" without specific ownership, creating invisible debt accumulation.

5. **Performance barely met targets** — Story 0-2 measured 7.63s generation time vs 8s ceiling (95% consumed). No headroom for degradation.

6. **Validation process bottleneck** — Story 0-5 dragged from Feb 4 to Feb 11 due to manual testing requirements, product decision process, and Tauri WebView2 regression requiring a standalone test script.

---

## Key Insights & Learnings

1. **Spike architecture decisions echo forward** — The patterns established in Epic 0 (streaming architecture, event naming, Zustand store approach, testing setup) became the foundation for the entire project. Investing in spike quality pays dividends.

2. **AI detection scores are unreliable as deterministic acceptance criteria** — ZeroGPT-style tools produce stochastic results that vary significantly across runs. Future validation should use multi-run medians, multi-tool consensus, or qualitative assessment instead of single-run threshold checks.

3. **"Deferred to later" is a debt accumulation anti-pattern** — Without a specific destination epic/story, deferred items become invisible. Every deferral needs an explicit owner and target.

4. **Frontend-only testing creates false coverage confidence** — Mocking the Tauri invoke boundary means we test the UI layer but not the actual business logic in Rust. This is a systemic gap.

5. **Manual testing stories need upfront process definition** — Story 0-5 would have benefited from pre-defined evidence requirements, tool versions, and reproducibility instructions before testing began (not added retroactively during code review).

## Technical Debt Inventory

| # | Item | Source | Priority | Assigned To | Target |
|---|------|--------|----------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | HTTP client not pooled (per-request creation) | 0-2, 0-3 | Medium | Charlie | Before Story 1-13 |
| 2 | Zero Rust backend unit tests | 0-2, 0-3 | High | Charlie + Elena | Start with Story 1-1 |
| 3 | Timer cleanup on CopyButton unmount | 0-4 | Low | Elena | Epic 8 |
| 4 | Emoji icons instead of SVG (cross-platform) | 0-4 | Low | Elena | Epic 8 |
| 5 | Event constants duplicated (TS/Rust) | 0-3 | Low | Elena | Ongoing |
| 6 | No streaming heartbeat/timeout | 0-3 | Low | Charlie | When needed |
| 7 | AC-2 timing measurement incomplete | 0-3 | Low | Dana | Manual verification |

## Next Epic Preview: Epic 1 — Basic Data Persistence

**Story count:** 16 (3x increase from Epic 0)

**Dependencies on Epic 0:**
- Full Tauri v2 + React 19 + Rust scaffold (0-1)
- Claude API module and prompt template (0-2)
- Streaming architecture: Tauri events → Zustand → UI (0-3)
- Clipboard infrastructure (0-4)

**Key new capabilities:**
- SQLite database with rusqlite 0.38
- Migration framework (refinery 0.9)
- Settings persistence (key-value store)
- Proposal and job post storage
- API key management (plaintext, keychain in Epic 2)
- Encryption stack spike (de-risking Epic 2)
- Onboarding flow and logging (moved from Epic 8)

**Assessment:** No blocking dependencies. Epic 0 scaffold is ready. Epic 1 can start immediately.

## Action Items

### Process Improvements

| # | Action | Owner | Deadline | Success Criteria |
|---|--------|-------|----------|-----------------|
| 1 | Stop using "deferred to Epic 8" as catch-all | Bob (SM) | Immediately | Every deferred item gets specific epic or explicit "won't fix" |
| 2 | Establish deterministic AI detection validation criteria | Alice (PO) + Charlie | Before re-validation | New criteria account for stochastic scores (median of N runs, multi-tool) |
| 3 | Define manual testing process template | Dana (QA) | Before next validation story | Template with evidence requirements, tool versions, reproducibility |

### Technical Debt

| # | Action | Owner | Priority | Target |
|---|--------|-------|----------|--------|
| 1 | Fix HTTP client connection pooling | Charlie | Medium | Before Story 1-13 |
| 2 | Add Rust backend unit tests (establish pattern) | Charlie + Elena | High | Story 1-1 |
| 3 | Timer cleanup on CopyButton unmount | Elena | Low | Epic 8 |
| 4 | Event constants sync (TS/Rust) | Elena | Low | Ongoing |

### Team Agreements

- Every Rust module gets at least basic unit tests going forward
- Code review deferred items must specify which epic/story will address them
- Performance targets get 20% headroom (e.g., target 6.4s if ceiling is 8s)

## Epic 1 Preparation Tasks

| Task | Owner | When | Blocking? |
|------|-------|------|-----------|
| Fix HTTP client pooling in claude.rs | Charlie | Before Story 1-13 | No |
| Add first Rust unit test in Story 1-1 | Elena | With Story 1-1 | No |
| Research refinery 0.9 migration patterns | Elena | Before Story 1-11 | No |

**No critical blockers** — Epic 1 can start immediately.

---

## Readiness Assessment

| Area | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Testing & Quality | Adequate for spike | 69 frontend tests, 0 Rust tests |
| Deployment | N/A | Desktop app in development |
| Stakeholder Acceptance | Partial | Foundation accepted; AI detection remains open |
| Technical Health | Good | Scaffold stable, architecture proven |
| Unresolved Blockers | 1 | Tauri WebView2 regression (workaround: standalone script) |

---

## Commitments Summary

- **Action Items:** 7
- **Preparation Tasks:** 3
- **Critical Path Items:** 0
- **Significant Discoveries:** 1 (AI detection validation failure — product-level, does not block Epic 1)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Begin Epic 1 immediately** — no blockers
2. **Fix HTTP client pooling** before Story 1-13
3. **Establish Rust testing pattern** starting with Story 1-1
4. **Review action items** in next standup
5. **Revisit AI detection validation criteria** before any future re-test
