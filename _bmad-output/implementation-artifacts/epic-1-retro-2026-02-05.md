---

## What Went Well (Successes) ✅

### 1. Code Review Process Caught Critical Issues Before Production

**Evidence:** Stories 1-13, 1-14, and 1-16 all had formal code reviews that identified 3-10 issues each.

**Impact:**
- Story 1-13: Found race condition in retry logic that would have caused UI/state mismatch
- Story 1-14: Identified race condition in draft auto-save violating NFR-11 atomicity
- Story 1-16: Discovered 13 issues including architecture conflicts and missing integrations

**Lesson:** Adversarial code review with "fresh context" (separate agent/person) finds significantly more issues than inline review during development.

### 2. Consistent Test Coverage Across All Stories

**Evidence:** All 16 stories included tests, with 84 tests passing by epic completion.

**Impact:**
- High confidence in database operations, API integration, and UI functionality
- Regression testing caught issues early (e.g., Story 1-16 review fixes didn't break existing tests)
- Foundation for Epic 2's high-risk database migration

**Lesson:** Test-first approach and mandatory test writing per story paid dividends.

### 3. Database Setup & Migration Framework Solid Foundation

**Evidence:** Stories 1-1, 1-2, 1-11 established rusqlite with WAL mode, refinery migrations, and clear patterns.

**Impact:**
- Epic 2 (SQLCipher migration) has clear path forward
- Migration pattern tested and documented (V1→V2→V3→V4 migrations working)
- Connection management (Mutex<Connection>) working correctly

**Lesson:** Infrastructure stories early in epic reduce risk for dependent stories.

### 4. Architecture Requirements (AR) and NFRs Referenced Consistently

**Evidence:** All story files included "Architecture Requirements" sections citing specific AR-X and NFR-X numbers.

**Impact:**
- Reduced architectural drift
- Clear traceability from requirements to implementation
- Easier to validate compliance (e.g., NFR-4: UI response <100ms)

**Lesson:** Linking implementation to requirements improves quality and auditability.

### 5. Logging Infrastructure Moved Early (Round 6 Critical Resequencing)

**Evidence:** Story 1-16 moved from Epic 8 to Epic 1 based on lessons learned.

**Impact:**
- Debugging capabilities available for Epic 2's complex migration work
- Early detection of issues in draft recovery and API error handling
- Foundation for production incident diagnosis

**Lesson:** Infrastructure belongs early, not as "polish" later.

### 6. Technical Debt Explicitly Documented in Code Reviews

**Evidence:** Stories 1-13, 1-14, 1-16 documented deferred issues as "Review Follow-ups" with severity, location, and impact.

**Impact:**
- Debt is visible and tracked (not hidden in comments or forgotten)
- Clear backlog for Epic 2 and beyond
- Epic-level debt summary created (epic-2-deferred-tasks.md)

**Lesson:** Structured debt documentation prevents "out of sight, out of mind" technical debt accumulation.

### 7. Dark Mode Shipped Early for Developer Comfort

**Evidence:** Story 1-5 implemented basic dark mode CSS.

**Impact:**
- Developer eye strain reduced during extended development sessions
- User experience consideration from day 1
- Foundation for full theme system in Epic 8

**Lesson:** Developer experience improvements have ROI during development, not just production.

---

## What Didn't Go Well (Challenges) ⚠️

### 1. Race Conditions in Async Operations (Recurring Pattern)

**Evidence:**
- Story 1-13: Race in retry logic (incrementRetry() timing)
- Story 1-14: Race in draft auto-save (concurrent saves violating NFR-11)

**Impact:**
- Required fixes and re-testing
- Pattern suggests async Rust complexity underestimated
- Similar issues likely in Epic 2 if not addressed

**Root Cause:** Async operations with shared state (Mutex, channels) require careful ordering and synchronization.

**Action Required:** Create async testing guidelines and patterns document.

### 2. Architecture Conflicts Requiring Deferrals

**Evidence:** Story 1-16 log level initialization order conflict.

**Impact:**
- Log level setting saved but never read on startup (hardcoded "INFO" used)
- Chicken-egg problem: logging needs DB, but DB errors need logging
- Deferred to Epic 2 when setup sequence refactored for encryption

**Root Cause:** Initialization order not planned upfront - discovered during implementation.

**Action Required:** Add initialization order checklist to architecture review.

### 3. Performance Targets Not Validated (NFR-1, NFR-4)

**Evidence:** Story 1-1 Task 5 (startup time <2s validation) marked incomplete with "REQUIRES MANUAL VERIFICATION".

**Impact:**
- Unknown if NFR-1 (startup <2s) is met
- Unknown if NFR-4 (UI response <100ms) is met
- Risk that Epic 2's encryption overhead violates targets

**Root Cause:** Manual performance testing not prioritized; no automated perf tests.

**Action Required:** Add performance regression testing to CI pipeline.

### 4. Story Status Tracking Confusion

**Evidence:** Story 1-11 marked "done" but code review found the feature was already implemented in Story 1-1.

**Impact:**
- Sprint status doesn't reflect reality
- Difficult to know actual progress
- Epic completion validation unreliable

**Root Cause:** Unclear lifecycle for "done" status; no checklist for completion.

**Action Required:** Establish story status lifecycle SOP (when to mark done, review, etc.).

### 5. Manual Tests Require Validation

**Evidence:** Multiple stories have manual test steps (NFR validation, AI detection testing in Story 0-5).

**Impact:**
- Tests not run, so unknown if features work
- Risk of shipping broken features
- Technical debt in testing infrastructure

**Root Cause:** Manual tests lack clear checklists and ownership.

**Action Required:** Add manual test checklist to story template with sign-off.

### 6. Project Structure Friction (Minor)

**Evidence:** package.json location caused confusion during development.

**Impact:**
- Time wasted on path resolution
- Minor friction, but repeated across stories

**Root Cause:** Tauri v2 project structure with nested frontend not fully understood.

**Action Required:** Document project structure clearly in developer onboarding.

## Key Insights & Lessons Learned 💡

### 1. Separate Code Review Agent Finds More Issues

**Insight:** Using a separate "adversarial reviewer" with fresh context found 3-10 issues per story, including critical race conditions and missing integrations that dev agent missed.

**Evidence:**
- Story 1-13: 2 HIGH issues found (race conditions)
- Story 1-14: 3 HIGH issues found (including NFR violations)
- Story 1-16: 13 issues found (8 HIGH, 3 MEDIUM, 2 LOW)

**Application:** Continue code review workflow for all stories in Epic 2. Consider increasing review frequency for complex/risky stories (migration, encryption).

### 2. Initialization Order Requires Upfront Planning

**Insight:** Setup sequence (logging vs DB vs config) has interdependencies that must be designed, not discovered.

**Evidence:** Story 1-16 discovered logging needs DB for settings, but DB errors need logging - resulted in deferred work.

**Application:** Before Epic 2 starts, design complete initialization sequence:
- What order: passphrase entry → keychain retrieval → logging init → DB migration → config load
- Document dependencies and constraints
- Validate in architecture review before implementation

### 3. Async Testing Needs Different Patterns

**Insight:** Rust async operations with shared state are difficult to test correctly. Race conditions found in code review, not during testing.

**Evidence:** Stories 1-13 and 1-14 both had race conditions that passed tests but were caught in review.

**Application:**
- Create async testing patterns guide (channel draining, tokio::time::pause, etc.)
- Add concurrency tests for shared state operations
- Review async code extra carefully

### 4. Manual Test Steps Need Explicit Checklists

**Insight:** "Manual verification required" tasks are consistently deferred/skipped without explicit checklists.

**Evidence:** Story 1-1 NFR validation, Story 0-5 AI detection testing.

**Application:**
- Add "Manual Test Checklist" section to story template
- Require sign-off from QA or user before marking done
- Consider which manual tests can be automated

### 5. Deferred Debt Needs Epic-Level Visibility

**Insight:** Debt documented in individual stories is easy to lose track of. Epic-level summary makes debt visible.

**Evidence:** Story 1-16 created epic-2-deferred-tasks.md to track log level initialization task.

**Application:**
- At end of each epic, create summary document for deferred work
- Include in next epic's planning
- Prevents "forgotten debt" accumulation

## Technical Debt Identified 🔧

### HIGH Priority (Must address in Epic 2) - 12-18 hours

1. **Story 1-16: Fix log level initialization from database** (6-8 hours)
   - **Issue:** Log level setting saved but never read on startup (hardcoded "INFO")
   - **Impact:** User settings ignored; Epic 2 setup refactoring provides opportunity to fix
   - **Location:** lib.rs:413, logs/mod.rs
   - **Tracked:** epic-2-deferred-tasks.md

2. **Story 1-14: Add database transaction wrapping for draft updates** (4-6 hours)
   - **Issue:** Draft updates not wrapped in explicit transactions (violates NFR-19)
   - **Impact:** Potential data inconsistency if write fails mid-operation
   - **Location:** db/queries/proposals.rs:139-149
   - **Note:** Deferred due to API constraints; single UPDATEs are atomic in SQLite

3. **Add performance regression testing to CI** (2-4 hours)
   - **Issue:** NFR-1 (startup <2s) and NFR-4 (UI response <100ms) not validated
   - **Impact:** Unknown if targets met; risk of regression in Epic 2
   - **Action:** Add automated perf tests for startup time and UI responsiveness

### MEDIUM Priority (Address in Epic 3+) - 7-10 hours

4. **Story 1-13: Add loading state during retry backoff** (2-3 hours)
   - **Issue:** During 1-4s delay, Retry button still clickable with no feedback
   - **Impact:** User can spam Retry causing multiple concurrent retries
   - **Location:** ProposalOutput.tsx:47, App.tsx:132-143

5. **Story 1-13: Replace alert() with toast notifications** (3-4 hours)
   - **Issue:** Uses blocking alert() for "Job saved!" notification
   - **Impact:** Poor UX, old-school pattern
   - **Location:** App.tsx:158, 164

6. **Story 1-14: Add integration test for complete draft recovery flow** (2-3 hours)
   - **Issue:** No end-to-end test for crash→restart→modal flow
   - **Impact:** AC-1 not fully validated
   - **Note:** Backend tests complete; frontend integration test missing

### LOW Priority (Address in v1.1+) - 8-13 hours

7. **Story 1-13: Add CSS visual regression tests** (2-3 hours)
   - **Issue:** New .error-actions styles not tested
   - **Impact:** Might break in dark mode or different screen sizes
   - **Location:** App.css:680-720

8. **Story 1-14: Clean up deprecated generate_proposal_streaming** (1-2 hours)
   - **Issue:** Deprecated function still in codebase (claude.rs:183-188)
   - **Impact:** Code clutter, minor confusion
   - **Note:** Acceptable technical debt for now

9. **Story 1-13: Add get/list/delete functions to job_posts.rs** (5-8 hours)
   - **Issue:** Only has insert_job_post, missing CRUD operations
   - **Impact:** Epic 4a will need these functions
   - **Note:** Intentional per story scope; documenting for future reference

**Total Estimated Debt:** 27-41 hours

## Action Items for Process Improvement 📋

### Action 1: Add Manual Test Checklist to Story Template

**Owner:** Scrum Master (Bob)
**Deadline:** Before Epic 2 planning session
**Success Criteria:** Story template includes "Manual Test Checklist" section with sign-off field
**Priority:** HIGH

**Rationale:** Manual NFR validation and feature testing consistently skipped without explicit checklists. This caused deferred validation in Stories 1-1, 0-5, and others.

### Action 2: Create Async Testing Guidelines Document

**Owner:** Senior Dev (Charlie)
**Deadline:** Before Epic 2 Story 2-3 (database migration)
**Success Criteria:** Document covers race condition testing, channel draining, tokio::time patterns, and shared state testing
**Priority:** HIGH

**Rationale:** Race conditions in Stories 1-13 and 1-14 suggest async Rust testing patterns need codification. Epic 2's migration involves complex async operations.

### Action 3: Add Performance Regression Testing to CI

**Owner:** Senior Dev (Charlie) + DevOps
**Deadline:** Before Epic 2 Story 2-3 (migration implementation)
**Success Criteria:** CI runs automated tests for NFR-1 (startup <2s) and NFR-4 (UI <100ms), fails build if violated
**Priority:** MEDIUM

**Rationale:** NFR validation currently manual and skipped. Epic 2 encryption overhead could violate performance targets.

### Action 4: Establish Story Status Lifecycle SOP

**Owner:** Scrum Master (Bob)
**Deadline:** Before Epic 2 starts
**Success Criteria:** Documented SOP defining when stories move between backlog→ready-for-dev→in-progress→review→done, with checklist per status
**Priority:** MEDIUM

**Rationale:** Confusion about when to mark stories "done" (Story 1-11 example). Need clear lifecycle.

### Action 5: Create Epic-Level Deferred Debt Summary

**Owner:** Scrum Master (Bob)
**Deadline:** End of every epic
**Success Criteria:** Markdown file in implementation-artifacts summarizing all deferred technical debt from code reviews, with estimates and priority
**Priority:** LOW

**Rationale:** Story 1-16 created epic-2-deferred-tasks.md. Make this pattern standard to prevent forgotten debt.

## Significant Discoveries 🔍

### Discovery 1: No Architectural Assumptions Changed ✅

**Finding:** Epic 1 execution validated the architecture decisions from architecture.md. No major surprises or invalidated assumptions.

**Impact on Epic 2:** ✅ No changes needed. Epic 2 plan remains valid.

**Evidence:**
- rusqlite with WAL mode worked as expected
- Tauri event system handled streaming correctly
- Migration framework (refinery) pattern successful

### Discovery 2: Initialization Order More Complex Than Expected ⚠️

**Finding:** Setup sequence has circular dependencies (logging needs DB for settings, but DB errors need logging) not anticipated in architecture.

**Impact on Epic 2:** ⚠️ REQUIRES PLANNING. Must design initialization sequence before Story 2-3 (migration).

**Recommendation:** Add initialization order design session before Epic 2 starts. Document all dependencies and constraints.

### Discovery 3: Code Review Effectiveness Exceeded Expectations ✅

**Finding:** Adversarial code review found critical issues (race conditions, missing features, architecture conflicts) that testing and dev review missed.

**Impact on Epic 2:** ✅ CONTINUE PRACTICE. Code review for all stories, especially high-risk Stories 2-3 and 2-5.

**Evidence:** 3 reviews found 21 total issues (13 in Story 1-16 alone), including issues that would have caused production problems.

### Discovery 4: Manual Testing Often Skipped ⚠️

**Finding:** Manual validation tasks (NFR testing, AI detection) consistently deferred without explicit accountability.

**Impact on Epic 2:** ⚠️ PROCESS CHANGE NEEDED. Epic 2 has manual testing requirements (passphrase strength, migration verification). Must improve compliance.

**Recommendation:** Implement Action Item 1 (manual test checklist) and assign QA owner for all manual tests.

### Discovery 5: Story Sequencing Matters More Than Expected 💡

**Finding:** Moving logging from Epic 8 to Epic 1 was critical for debugging. Infrastructure stories early reduce risk.

**Impact on Epic 2:** ✅ VALIDATES APPROACH. Epic 2's early backup story (2-2) reduces migration risk.

**Insight:** Continue prioritizing infrastructure and safety stories early in epics, not as "polish" at the end.

---

## Readiness Assessment 🎯

### Testing & Quality: ✅ Ready

**Status:** All stories have tests. 84 tests passing (Rust + Frontend). Code review process active and effective.

**Gaps:**
- Manual NFR validation pending (startup time, UI responsiveness)
- Integration test for draft recovery flow missing (Story 1-14)

**Action Needed:** Run manual NFR tests (Prep Task 5) before Epic 2 starts.

**Confidence Level:** HIGH - Test coverage strong, code review catching issues.

---

### Deployment: ⚠️ Not Ready (Expected)

**Status:** Development phase only. No production deployment planned until Epic 9.

**Gaps:**
- No production environment

**Concerns:**
- 9 technical debt items documented (27-41 hours)
- 1 HIGH priority debt item must be addressed in Epic 2 (log level initialization)
- Race condition pattern suggests async complexity

**Action Needed:**
- Address Story 1-16 deferred task during Epic 2 setup refactoring
- Implement async testing guidelines before Story 2-3

**Confidence Level:** HIGH - Technical debt manageable and tracked.

---

### Blockers: ✅ Zero Blockers

**Status:** No unresolved blockers for Epic 2.

**Dependencies Verified:**
- ✅ Database setup complete (Story 1-1)
- ✅ Migration framework working (Story 1-11)
- ✅ Logging infrastructure in place (Story 1-16)
- ✅ Settings table ready (Story 1-8)
