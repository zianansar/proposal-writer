Hey,

Just read through your requirements for the dashboard project. This is exactly the kind of work I enjoy.

Quick background:
- React dev for 4 years
- Strong TypeScript skills
- Built several data viz projects (most recently a logistics tracking dashboard)

I'm comfortable with both Chart.js and D3 depending on your needs. My strength is making complex data easy to understand visually while keeping the codebase maintainable.

Can commit 30 hours/week, rate is $60/hr. Open to discussing the technical approach—I usually start with a quick spike to validate the architecture before diving into full implementation.

Let me know if you want to chat.

Sam
