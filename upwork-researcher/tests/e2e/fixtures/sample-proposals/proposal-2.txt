Hello,

Your dashboard project looks interesting. Here's why I'd be a good fit:

Technical Background:
- 6 years React/TypeScript
- Built 12+ dashboards with real-time data
- Experience with D3, Recharts, Victory

Recent example: I delivered a financial analytics dashboard for a crypto exchange that handles 50k+ data points with sub-100ms render times.

I prefer a test-driven approach and can provide architectural documentation as we build. Rate is $65/hr, negotiable for long-term engagement.

Available to start Monday. Let me know if you'd like to see my portfolio or discuss the technical stack.

Thanks,
Jordan
