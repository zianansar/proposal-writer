Hi there,

I noticed your React dashboard project and it aligns perfectly with my recent work. I've spent the last 5 years building data-heavy interfaces for fintech and SaaS companies.

What caught my eye:
- Your need for real-time data visualization
- The emphasis on clean, maintainable code

My approach would be to start with a solid component architecture using React 19 + TypeScript, integrate Chart.js or D3 for the visualizations, and ensure everything is properly tested with Jest and React Testing Library.

I'm currently available 30+ hours/week and could start immediately. Would you be open to a quick call to discuss the technical requirements?

Best,
Alex
