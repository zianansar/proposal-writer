# Cargo configuration for Windows MSVC builds with OpenSSL
# This configures the build to use vcpkg-installed OpenSSL instead of building from source

# Note: These Windows-specific settings are temporarily commented out for macOS development
# Uncomment when building on Windows

# [env]
# # Use vcpkg OpenSSL installation (installed at C:/vcpkg)
# OPENSSL_DIR = "C:/vcpkg/installed/x64-windows"
# OPENSSL_NO_VENDOR = "1"
# VCPKG_ROOT = "C:/vcpkg"
